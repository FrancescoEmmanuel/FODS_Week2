# FODS_Week2
This is a repo for my FODS week 2 assignment <br> 

I went the extra mile by webscraping NBA players' statistics from the past 10 years from 2013-2023 - done by looping through the web pages pages from 2013 to 2023 and writing it into an HTML file. I then put all of these html files into a directory and reading it. This is where I scrape the data and get the statistics from the table i want. <bt> <br>

I further went the extra mile more by webscraping team statistics of the most recent season from a different source, and merge the two tables found in this website into one dataframe.
